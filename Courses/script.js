<ul>
    <li><strong>Firewall Basics:</strong> Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.</li>
    <li><strong>Types of Firewalls:</strong> There are several types of firewalls, including:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Packet Filtering Firewalls:</strong> Examine packets at the network layer and make decisions based on predefined rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewalls:</strong> Track the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Proxy Firewalls:</strong> Act as intermediaries between users and services, filtering requests and responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs):</strong> Combine traditional firewall functions with additional features like encrypted traffic inspection, intrusion prevention systems, and application awareness.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ports and Protocols:</strong> Network ports are logical endpoints for communication. Firewalls use port numbers to allow or block traffic. Common ports include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Port 80:</strong> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</li>
            <li><strong>Port 443:</strong> HTTPS (HTTP Secure)</li>
            <li><strong>Port 25:</strong> SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</li>
            <li><strong>Port 21:</strong> FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Firewall Rules:</strong> Firewalls operate based on a set of rules that define what traffic is allowed or denied. These rules can be based on IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and other criteria. Properly configured firewall rules are essential for effective network security.</li>
    <li><strong>Importance of Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls are critical in protecting networks from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and data breaches. They help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.</li>
